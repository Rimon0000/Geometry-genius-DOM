          <div class="px-4">
            <h3 class="blog-title">Question-1: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
            <p class="answer-p">Answer: DOM means Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document.
             We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.</p>

             <h3 class="blog-title">Question-2: How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h3>
             <p class="answer-p">Answer: There are a five different methods for selecting an element in the HTML document.</p>
             <ul class="answer-p">
                <li>1. getElementById()</li>
                <li>2. getElementsByClassName()</li>
                <li>3. getElementsByTagName()</li>
                <li>4. querySelector()</li>
                <li>5. querySelectorAll()</li>
             </ul>

             <h3 class="blog-title">Question-3: What is event bubble?</h3>
             <p class="answer-p">Answer: Event bubble is a method of event in the HTML DOM. 
                It happens when an element receives an event,
                and that event bubbles up or propagated to its parent elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-title">Question-4: What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
            <p class="answer-p">Answer: When a function call another function is called callback function.
                I use it because Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. 
                It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.
